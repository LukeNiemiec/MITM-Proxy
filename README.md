This program creates a HTTPS proxy server on port 9080 and opens a GUI where you can make a request through the proxy.
Once a valid request is made, the proxy server displays the captured HTTP headers from the client and the host/website.

There are two ways to execute the program by running either commands:
      ```java App.java```
      OR
      ```java -jar MITMProxy.jar```
